            <p style="text-indent: 25px; text-align: justify;">I am currently a senior at Plainedge High School.
                Throughout all of high school I have been mainly
                focusing on business electives and with some research, I grew a desire for a career in the cybersecurity
                field. I believe that I am very skilled in computers, technology, and mathematics, so I know a career in
                an area like this will be a good choice for me to pursue. While in high school I made many
                accomplishments I am proud of, such as getting a job and becoming co-president of PlainedgeTV. I enjoy
                working and was quickly able to taking on leadership roles. As co-president of the PlaindgeTV club, I
                took on tasks such as creating <a href="https://www.plainedgetv.com"
                    target="_blank">www.PlainedgeTV.com</a> and bringing it to where
                it stands today. I always try to attend as many PlainedgeTV events as I can to get myself
                more engaged in the club and it gives me a good opportunity to meet students from other grade levels.
                Outside of school activities, I was also able to volunteer as a way to give back to my community through
                Plainedge Public Library.

                While in high school I plan on taking on an internship in IT to better my understanding for the real
                world. After high school I plan on attending a 4 year college to major in cybersecurity and minor in
                business/finance. Being able to take on another internship while in college would really help me gain
                even more experience in the real world and set me up for when I graduate college and begin to search for
                a long term job.
