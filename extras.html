                        At Metro Meat Market I am responsible for ensuring stock is replenished throughout the day,
                        purchasing supplies, and making sure outgoing and incoming deliveries are accurate and on time.
                        I was also responsible for creating a website for this business as well as managing 3rd-party
                        delivery services.

                        During my time working here I was able to gain skills such as the ability to multitask,
                        problem-solving
                        abilities, and improve in customer service. At work I assist in many different positions such as
                        cash register, preparing food, and bagging orders. Whilst at the cash register I was able to
                        assist customers with any questions they have and get a better understanding of the work
                        process. Stepping up to preparing food allowed me to get better at multitasking by working on
                        many different orders at a time. Bagging food altogether was a huge advancement and required me
                        to be able to accurately prepare many orders at the same time as well as adapt to order changes.
