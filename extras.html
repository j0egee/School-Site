                        Volunteering at the public library allowed me to give back to my community in an engaging way.
                        Volunteering involved assisting kids and staff at various events, such as fairs or movie nights.
                        This opportunity was able to show me how much helping others can benifit the community and does
                        not need to be rewarded all of the time.

                        While volunteering at Rocco's voice, I assisted in organizing fundraisers to support families
                        with children with autism. This organization helps support local families with more then just
                        funds; by giving them opportunities.

                        At Stevens Institute of Technology I was able to discover the field of cybersecurity hands on. I
                        was able to learn more about the topic and see if it was truly what I wanted to pursue in
                        college. I was able to experience dorm life and prepare myself for my college years ahead.
